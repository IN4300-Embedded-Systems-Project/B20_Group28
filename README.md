# Wireless Security System with RFID

## Project Description:

This project is an RFID-based solenoid lock system that allows access control using RFID cards. When an authorized RFID card is placed near the RC522 RFID reader, the system activates a solenoid lock, allowing entry. If an unauthorized card is used, access is denied, triggering a red LED and buzzer alarm.

## Key Features:
- Uses RFID authentication to control access.
- Solenoid lock activation for authorized users.
- LED indicators (green for access granted, red for denied).
- Buzzer alert for unauthorized attempts.
- Relay module to control the solenoid lock.

## Components Used:

- Arduino UNO
- RC522 RFID reader
- Electric locks
- 5V Relay
- Buzzer
- LED
- Breadboard
- Jumpers
- Power Supply
